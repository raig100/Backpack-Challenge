Backpack Price prediction Challenge
Backpack price prediction machine learning model project, implied several models:
1) Linear Regression - failed due to low accurcy, Root Mean Squeared Error(RMSE) at around 1500
2) ElasticNet - success, RMSE ~39.16
room for improvement:
1)feature generation - extract existing features and based on them generate new, more detailed featurses that might be of use for the model
2)model tuning - time-consuming process, that might find more suitable parameters for the model, failed this time due to low computing resourses.
